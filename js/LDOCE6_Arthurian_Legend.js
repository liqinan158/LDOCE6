Arthur became king of Britain when he succeeded in pulling a sword called Excalibur out of a stone – something that only the person who would be king could do. Arthur is known for being brave, fair, and morally good. His court at <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">Camelot</span></span> was famous for bravery,<span class="nondv"> <span class="refhwd">chivalry</span></span>, and magic which was practised by the <span class="nondv"> <span class="refhwd">magician</span></span> <span class="nondv"> <span class="refhwd">Merlin</span></span>, and the <span class="nondv"> <span class="refhwd">sorceress</span></span> <span class="nondv"> <span class="refhwd">Morgan le Fay</span></span>. There, at the <span class="nondv"> <span class="refhwd">round table</span></span>, sat the bravest <span class="nondv"> <span class="refhwd">knight</span><span class="suffix">s</span></span> in the land, the <span class="nondv"> <span class="refhwd">knights of the round table</span></span>. These knights included Sir <span class="nondv"> <span class="refhwd">Galahad</span></span>, Sir <span class="nondv"> <span class="refhwd">Lancelot</span></span>, and Sir Bedivere. Arthur’s power began to fail when he discovered the love between his wife, Guinevere, and his best friend, Lancelot, and the knights began the long search for the <span class="nondv"> <span class="refhwd">holy grail</span><span class="gloss"><span class="neutral"> (=</span>the cup used by Jesus Christ at his last meal<span class="neutral">)</span></span></span> which was finally found and brought back by Galahad. Arthur’s strength then returned and he went into battle to save Britain from <span class="nondv"> <span class="refhwd">Mordred</span></span>, an evil knight. Arthur killed Mordred, but he was seriously wounded. He gave Excalibur to Bedivere and ordered him to throw it into a lake. When he did this, the hand of the <span class="nondv"> <span class="refhwd">lady of the lake</span></span> appeared from under the water, caught the sword, and disappeared under the water with it. Then three women arrived on a boat and took Arthur to the island of <span class="nondv"> <span class="refhwd">Avalon</span></span> to die. It is said that Arthur will return if Britain is ever in danger again.</span></span></span></div><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_2_p028-000001743" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_2_p028-000001743.mp3"></audio><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_2_p028-000001743" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_2_p028-000001743.mp3"></audio>`;
