Lockerbie became famous when a US plane, known as Pan Am Flight 103, crashed onto the town in 1988, killing 270 people. The plane was carrying a bomb, which was put there by someone working for the Libyan government. A Libyan man was given a <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">life sentence</span></span> in a Scottish prison for his part in the bombing. The Libyan government finally admitted that it was responsible for the bombing in 2003, and agreed to pay a total of more than $2 billion to the families of the people who were killed.</span></span></span></div><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_5_p028-000007482" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_5_p028-000007482.mp3"></audio><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_5_p028-000007482" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_5_p028-000007482.mp3"></audio>`;
