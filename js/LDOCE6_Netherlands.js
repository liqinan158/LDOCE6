Population: 16,805,037 (2014). The capital is Amsterdam, but the government is based in The Hague. Most of the country is flat and large parts of it are below sea level. The size of the Netherlands has been increased by draining (<span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">drain</span></span> ) land that was formerly under the sea and building a system of <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">dyke</span><span class="suffix">s</span></span> to keep the sea back. British and American people often call the country Holland, but this is not officially correct because Holland is only one part of the Netherlands. When people think of the Netherlands, they often think of <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">windmill</span><span class="suffix">s</span></span>, which used to be very common there, of <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">tulip</span></span>s, which are grown in large quantities to be sold, and of <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">clog</span><span class="suffix">s</span><span class="gloss"><span class="neutral"> (=</span>wooden shoes<span class="neutral">)</span></span></span> which many people used to wear. The country is also known for its less strict attitude towards drugs, especially <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">cannabis</span></span>. People from the Netherlands are called Dutch.</span></span></span></div><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_a_p028-000008818" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_a_p028-000008818.mp3"></audio><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_a_p028-000008818" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_a_p028-000008818.mp3"></audio>`;
