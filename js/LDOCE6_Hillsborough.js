This event led to changes in the design of football grounds and in the methods used for controlling large crowds safely. A report in 2012 said that the actions of the police were largely responsible for the event, and some police officers had made false statements about their actions.</span></span></span></div><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_4_p028-000006077" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_4_p028-000006077.mp3"></audio><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_b_ld5_hillsborough" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_b_ld5_hillsborough.mp3"></audio>`;
