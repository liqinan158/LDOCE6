Bush) and the UK (under Prime Minister Tony Blair) attacked Iraq. Before the war, the US and UK governments claimed that Iraq had <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">weapons of mass destruction</span></span> (WMDs) which threatened the safety of their countries. This was one of the main reasons for the war. However, no weapons like these were ever found. The former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was caught, sent to a court of law, and later <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">execute</span><span class="suffix">d</span></span> by the new Iraqi government. The number of foreign soldiers was reduced and all U.S. soldiers left Iraq in 2011.
