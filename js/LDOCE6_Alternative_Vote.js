The votes for the first-choice candidate are counted first. If no candidate has a <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">majority</span></span>, the candidate with the fewest votes can no longer be elected. The votes for that candidate then go to the voters’ second-choice candidates instead. This process continues until one candidate becomes the winner by receiving more than half of all the votes. Supporters of AV argue that it is fairer than the usual system where people only vote for one candidate. In May 2011, people in the UK were asked if they wanted to change to this system in government elections. However, more than two-thirds of the voters voted against changing to AV.</span></span></span></div><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_4_ld5_alternative_v" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_4_ld5_alternative_v.mp3"></audio><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_4_ld5_alternative_v" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_4_ld5_alternative_v.mp3"></audio>`;
