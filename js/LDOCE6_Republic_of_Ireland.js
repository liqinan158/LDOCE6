Population: 4,775,982 (2014). Capital: Dublin. It was formerly ruled by the British, but it became an independent country in 1921 after a long fight, when Ireland was divided into Northern Ireland (which remained as part of the UK) and the Irish Free State, which later became the Republic of Ireland. Ireland is mainly a Roman Catholic country, and its <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">patron saint</span></span> is Saint Patrick and its national <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">symbol</span></span> is the <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">shamrock</span></span>. Its official languages are Irish Gaelic and English. Traditionally, Ireland’s main industry was farming, and many Irish people left the country to find work abroad, especially in the UK and the US. Ireland is known for its beautiful countryside, mountains, and coasts, so tourism is an important industry. The Irish are typically thought of as friendly people who enjoy conversation and are good talkers. They are known for their <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">pub</span><span class="suffix">s</span></span>, where people drink Guiness <span class="gloss"><span class="neutral"> (=</span>a dark beer<span class="neutral">)</span></span> and listen to Irish <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">folk music</span></span>.
