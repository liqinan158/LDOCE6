A prize-giving event is held at Tate Britain, an art <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">gallery</span></span> in London. Past winners have included Anish Kapoor (1991), Rachel Whiteread (1993), and Grayson Perry (2003). Since the prize was first awarded in 1984, some of the works in the competition have been very <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">controversial</span></span> <span class="gloss"><span class="neutral"> (=</span>caused a lot of disagreement among people<span class="neutral">)</span></span>. For example, in 1992 Damien Hirst showed a work consisting of a <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">shark</span></span> kept in <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">formaldehyde</span></span>, and in 1999 Tracey Emin’s work called <span class="bookfilm">My Bed</span>was actually her unmade bed. The prize is named after the painter J.M.W. Turner.</span></span></span></div><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_7_ld5_turner_prize" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_7_ld5_turner_prize.mp3"></audio><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_7_ld5_turner_prize" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_7_ld5_turner_prize.mp3"></audio>`;
