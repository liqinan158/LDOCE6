In Pinter's plays, actors have very realistic conversations, often with long silences, and they often misunderstand each other. This is used to show the problems people in ordinary social situations can have when trying to understand each other. Pinter was known for his left-wing views, and often criticized the UK government. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2005.</span></span></span></div><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_1_p028-000009771" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_1_p028-000009771.mp3"></audio><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_0_lpd_pinter" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_0_lpd_pinter.mp3"></audio>`;
