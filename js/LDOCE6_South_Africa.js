Population: 48,601,098 (2014). Capitals: Pretoria the <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">administrative</span></span> capital), Cape Town (the <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">legislative</span></span> capital), and Bloemfontein (the <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">judicial</span></span> capital). Largest city: Johannesburg. Although almost 75% of South Africa's population is black, the country was ruled for many years by an all-white government using the system of <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">apartheid</span></span>, which separated people of different races and gave no political rights to black people. People who actively opposed apartheid were often treated violently by the South African police and army. Because of this, South Africa was disapproved of all over the world. It was forced to leave the British Commonwealth in 1960, and in the 1980s, many countries established trade <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">sanction</span><span class="suffix">s</span></span> against South Africa <span class="gloss"><span class="neutral"> (=</span>restrictions on buying and selling goods<span class="neutral">)</span></span>. In the early 1990s, the white government finally agreed to get rid of apartheid, and in 1994 the African National Congress (ANC), led by Nelson Mandela, won South Africa's first fully <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">democratic</span></span> election and became the government. South Africa has many industries and produces many farm products, including fruit and wine, but its best known products are gold and <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">diamond</span><span class="suffix">s</span></span>. It is also a popular place for tourists who come especially to see wild animals such as lions and elephants in its <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">wildlife</span></span> parks. Some parts of South Africa are known for having a high level of crime.</span><span class="crossref"><span class="neutral"> →</span><a> <span class="refhwd">ANC</span></a><a><span class="neutral">, </span><span class="refhwd">Biko, Steve</span></a><a><span class="neutral">, </span><span class="refhwd">Boer War</span></a><a><span class="neutral">, </span><span class="refhwd">Mandela, Nelson</span></a><a><span class="neutral">, </span><span class="refhwd">Sharpeville</span></a><a><span class="neutral">, </span><span class="refhwd">Soweto</span></a></span></span></span></div><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_1_lpd_south_africa" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_1_lpd_south_africa.mp3"></audio><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_f_p028-000011382" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_f_p028-000011382.mp3"></audio>`;
