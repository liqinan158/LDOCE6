He is often shown in pictures holding an apple, because there is a story that he discovered the law of gravity when an apple fell on his head while he was sitting under a tree.</span></span></span></div><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_e_p028-000008881" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_e_p028-000008881.mp3"></audio><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_5_lpd_newton__n_" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_5_lpd_newton__n_.mp3"></audio>`;
