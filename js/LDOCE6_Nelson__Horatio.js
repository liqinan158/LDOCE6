He lost an arm and the sight in one eye during the wars against Napoleon, and he became very popular after winning several important battles at sea.

Before the battle he said to his men ‘England expects that every man will do his duty’, and as he lay dying he is believed to have said ‘Kiss me, Hardy’ to his friend Sir Thomas Hardy.
