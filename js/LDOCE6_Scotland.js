Population: 5,295,400 (2014). Capital: Edinburgh. Scotland was an independent country until the Scottish and English parliaments were united by the ‘Act of Union’ in 1707, and it still has a different legal system and a different education system from the rest of the UK. Scotland has had its own parliament since 1999. It is still part of the UK, but some groups such as the SNP (the Scottish National Party) want Scotland to become an independent country. Scottish Gaelic is still spoken by some people in the northwest of the country and in the islands off the west coast. Scotland is known for its beautiful countryside and its many <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">loch</span><span class="suffix">s</span><span class="gloss"><span class="neutral"> (=</span>lakes<span class="neutral">)</span></span></span>, islands, and mountains.
