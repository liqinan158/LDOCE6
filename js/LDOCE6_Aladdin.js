Aladdin is employed by a <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">magician</span></span> to steal a lamp from a secret <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">cave</span><span class="gloss"><span class="neutral"> (=</span>a large hole in the side of a cliff or under the ground<span class="neutral">)</span></span></span>, which is full of jewels and valuable objects. When Aladdin finds the lamp and rubs it, a <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">genie</span><span class="gloss"><span class="neutral"> (=</span>a creature with special powers<span class="neutral">)</span></span></span> appears and says to Aladdin, ‘Your wish is my command,’ by which he means that Aladdin may ask for anything he wants and the genie will give it to him. Aladdin keeps the lamp and, with the genie’s help, becomes rich and marries the <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">sultan</span><span class="suffix">'s</span></span> daughter. Then the magician, by offering ‘new lamps for old’, tricks Aladdin’s wife so that she exchanges the old magic lamp for an ordinary one. Aladdin finally finds the magician, kills him, and gets the magic lamp back again. The story of Aladdin is often performed as a <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">pantomime</span><span class="gloss"><span class="neutral"> (=</span>a humorous play for children<span class="neutral">)</span></span></span> in the UK during the period around Christmas.</span></span></span></div><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_0_p028-000001380" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_0_p028-000001380.mp3"></audio><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_0_p028-000001380" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_0_p028-000001380.mp3"></audio>`;
