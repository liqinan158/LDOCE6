It is known for having warm weather and pleasant beaches, and is very popular with tourists. A lot of people in Miami come from Hispanic <span class="gloss"><span class="neutral"> (=</span>Spanish-speaking<span class="neutral">)</span></span> countries, including many from Cuba, who came to Miami because they disliked Castro's <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">communist</span></span> government. Because of its large Hispanic population and its nearness to Latin America, many companies in Miami do a lot of business with companies in Central and South America. During the 1980s, the city became known as a centre of the illegal drugs trade, and in the past it had more murders than most other US cities.</span></span></span></div><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_8_p028-000008223" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_8_p028-000008223.mp3"></audio><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_8_p028-000008223" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_8_p028-000008223.mp3"></audio>`;
