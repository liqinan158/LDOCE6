Bodies were found hidden in a cupboard, under the floorboards and buried in the garden in 1953. In 1950 Timothy Evans, who lived in a flat at Rillington Place, had been executed after the bodies of his wife and baby were found. At his trial, Christie admitted a seventh killing, that of Mrs Evans, but denied murdering the baby. Christie was executed and Evans was given a posthumous free pardon in 1966.</span></span></span></div><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_b_lpd_christie" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_b_lpd_christie.mp3"></audio><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_2_lpd_christie__c_" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_2_lpd_christie__c_.mp3"></audio>`;
