He won political support in the Northern US states because of his speeches against <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">slavery</span></span>, but this made him unpopular in the Southern states, where slaves did most of the farm work. The American <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">civil war</span></span> started soon after he became president, when the Southern states decided to leave the US. In 1863 he announced the <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">emancipation proclamation</span></span>, by which all slaves in the US became free people. He also gave a famous speech known as the <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">gettysburg address</span></span> in 1863. A few days after the war ended, he was shot and killed in a theatre by an actor called John Wilkes <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">booth</span></span>. Lincoln is considered to be one of the most important US presidents, and was sometimes called ‘Honest Abe’ because everyone admired his honesty. His picture appears on the US five-dollar <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">bill</span></span> and on the one-cent coin.</span></span></span></div><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_c_p028-000007389" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_c_p028-000007389.mp3"></audio><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_b_lincoln1" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_b_lincoln1.mp3"></audio>`;
