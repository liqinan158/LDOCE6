Each film is given a <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">rating</span></span>, which shows for example that a film can be shown to anyone (G), or can be seen by children if an adult goes with them (PG). A film that has an ‘X’ rating probably has a lot of sex and violence in it, so can only be seen by people who are at least 18 years old.
