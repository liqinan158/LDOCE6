As a young man, he was known for being sexually attractive and was called ‘Elvis the Pelvis’ because of the way he moved the lower part of his body when he performed. Later, his performances became less active and exciting, and he sang mostly slow love songs. His many successful records had a great influence on popular music, and they include <span class="bookfilm">Heartbreak Hotel</span>, <span class="bookfilm">Blue Suede Shoes</span>, and <span class="bookfilm">Are you Lonesome Tonight?</span> He also appeared in many films, such as <span class="bookfilm">Jailhouse Rock</span> (1957) and <span class="bookfilm">G.I. Blues</span> (1960). He is often called ‘The King’, and some people say that they do not believe that he is dead. Millions of people go to visit his home in Memphis, Tennessee, which is called Graceland.</span></span></span></div><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_2_p028-000009955" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_2_p028-000009955.mp3"></audio><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_e_lpd_presley" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_e_lpd_presley.mp3"></audio>`;
