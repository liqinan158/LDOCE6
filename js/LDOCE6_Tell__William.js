According to a famous story, Tell was ordered by the Austrian <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">governor</span></span> to use his <span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">crossbow</span></span> to shoot an apple placed on his own son’s head. He succeeded in doing this because of his great skill, and later killed the governor. This encouraged the Swiss people to fight and gain their independence.
