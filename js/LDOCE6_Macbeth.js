Macbeth is told by three witches (<span class="nondv"><span class="refhwd">witch</span></span>) that he will become king. To do so, he murders the present king Duncan, who is visiting him in his castle. Although he feels very guilty about this, he kills several other people to keep his power until he is finally killed by Macduff. Actors believe it is unlucky to say the name <span class="bookfilm">Macbeth</span>, so they often call it <span class="bookfilm">The Scottish Play</span>.</span></span></span></div><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_1_p028-000007696" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_1_p028-000007696.mp3"></audio><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_1_p028-000007696" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_1_p028-000007696.mp3"></audio>`;
