Before this, the canal was owned and operated by a foreign company. When Egypt took control, the UK and France sent ships and soldiers to the area to try to get the canal back. This attempt failed, and it was criticized by most other countries, including the US and the former Soviet Union. The British and French forces left Egypt after a few months, and the British prime minister, Anthony Eden, gave up his position as a result of this. For many people in the UK, the Suez Crisis was a serious defeat and a sign that the UK was no longer an important international power. In the UK, the Suez Crisis is often simply called Suez.</span></span></span></div><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_2_p028-000011683" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_bre_2_p028-000011683.mp3"></audio><audio id="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_2_p028-000011683" preload="none" src="LDOCE6_hwd_ame_2_p028-000011683.mp3"></audio>`;
